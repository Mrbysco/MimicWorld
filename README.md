## About ##
This mod adds a new dimension called The 0therworld which is a copy of the overworld before the player left their mark on it, this mod's main uses would be to be used as a mining dimension and can easily be reset by deleting the dimension file, this way if a pack updates and adds new overworld world gen you could go to the otherworld and explore it without having to travel 500 chunks and 500 more.
